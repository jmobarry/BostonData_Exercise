# BostonData_Exercise

This is a data extraction exercise to get specific information out of a large data set representing employees in the Boston area.

Three functions are in the file to:
1.) Display all of the employees and their salaries
2.) Display the top 5 earners in the data set
3.) Display all of the employees who make over 200,000

To get this data to display in the HTML file you have to choose which methods to comment out.
